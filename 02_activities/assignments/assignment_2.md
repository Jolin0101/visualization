# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      The good one:

      1. Comprehensive Overview: The visualization provides a wide range of overview of London's demographics, including population density, economics trend, birth status. The holistic approach allows users to gain a nuanced understanding of the demographic composition of London.
      2. Interactive Elements: The interactive features of the Tabluea dashboard significantly enahnces uers engagement. Users can explore different aspects of the data by interacting with maps, bar charts, and pie charts. This presnetations of the data allows the users can explore the data themselves, which makes the data more accessible and easy to undersatnd. 
      3. Geographical Context: The use of maps to display demographic information provides a clear geographical context, which is crucial for understanding how various demographic variables are distrbuted across different area of London. This geographical representation helps users grasp the spatial patterns and relationships within the city's demographics, facilitating the identification of trends and disparities across different neighborhoods.
      4. Clear and Concise Visuals: The design of the visual elements is clean and intuitive, with well-defined labels, legends, and color schemes. The use of different chart types, suah as bar charts, helps convey different types of information effectively. For example, bar charts are particularly useful for comparing mean house prices acorss different borought,s allowing users to easily identify areas with higher or lower housing costs. The logical color-coding aids in quick visual comparisons, enhancing the overall readability and comprehension of the data. This clarity in design ensures that users can interpret the information without confusion, making the visualization more accessible and informative.
      5. Data-Driven Insights: The visualization offeres valuable data-driven insights. For example, understanding ethnic diversity can inform community programs and cultural initiatives, while insights into mean house prices can guide housing policy and urban development strategies. By analyzing these mean house prices, stakeholders can make informed decisions about where to focus efforts for affordable housing initiatives or economic development. This practical utility makes the visualization a powerful tool for informed decision-making, addressing both demographic trends and economic conditions within London.








      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sherzodbek.ibragimov/viz/DifferentMethodstoIdentifyOutliers/Dashboard
      1. The dashboard have too many charts and methods simultaneouly, making it difficult to understand the information.
      2. The use of the technical terms without note, comment and explanation makes the visualization hard to understand.
      3. The visual elements such as labels, colors are inconsistent which makes confusion.
      4. The layout is too crowded with too many charts and text.
      5. some charts do not have lables which is incompleted.

      Improvements
      1. Breakdown the information into multiple, smaller dashboards for one single method of data presenations. By using this way, users can easy to view the data and see the trend. 
      2. Provide more clarifications on the terminology. Should have some notes and comments to provide explaination, like adding a side panel with definitions and explanations. 
      3. Provide more filters to fullfill different's need. This dashboard is too simple.
      4. Improve the layout design. By adding more lables, different colors to enhance the visual effects.
      5. Include User Guidance. Add a user guide or mannul to help user to navigate and understand how to use the dashboard effectively.






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
